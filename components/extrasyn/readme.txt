--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This package contains about 35 highlighters for SynEdit, such as ruby, haskel, 
eiffel, fortran, modula 3, CA-Clipper, prolog, cobol, gnuplot, etc. 

They were provided by various users in bug report 
https://bugs.freepascal.org/view.php?id=18248.

There is a runtime and designtime package: compile the runtime package 
(extrahighlighters.lpk) and install the designtime package
(extrahighlighters_dsgn.lpk).

There is also a test application that creates and loads the highlighters. 
Some of them do not provide sample code and will not show anything in the
test application.
