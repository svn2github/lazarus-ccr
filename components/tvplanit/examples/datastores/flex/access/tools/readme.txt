Use the program CreateAccessDB to create an empty access databank, or one
which already contains the empty VisualPlanIt tables.

The database file can be created in two versions

* an *.mdb file of the old Access 97-2003. 32-bit only
* an *.accdb file for the newer Access 2007+ versions, 32 bit or 64 bit.

Note: On Win 10 the accdb driver is not installed by default. Install the
AccessDatabaseEngine (free Microsoft download):

* Office 2010: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=13255
* Office 2007: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=23734

Note: At the time of this writing the program does not run without error, 
reason unknown. However, before the error appears, the database file already
has been successfully created.

---------

The VisualPlanIt test program in the parent folder requires the database file
to be named either data.mdb or data.accdb. Copy the created mdb or accdb files 
into the parent folder.
