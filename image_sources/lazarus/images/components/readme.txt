The source files for creating the  palette icons of LCL components at 150% and 
200% magnification can be found here - see subfolders 150percent and 200percent.

The files are multi-layer gimp files for easier modification and changing
overlay icons. 

The source files in the subfolders "combined" contain icons for several 
components. Activate the layers needed for each component before exporting to 
png.

Origin of images
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The basic images (100% magnfication) are those from the Lazarus distribution.
Upscaling was achieved by gimp (bilinear interpolation). Manual editing
was applied to remove blurriness and to get more crispier images.
  
To get better results at higher resolution, some images were replaced.
