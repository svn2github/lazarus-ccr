The source files for creating the  palette icons of the sqlite components at 150% 
and 200% magnification can be found here.

The files are multi-layer gimp files for easier modification and changing
overlay icons. 

Each source file serves the TSqliteDataset and TSqlite3Dataset components. 
Activate the layers needed for each component before exporting to png.
