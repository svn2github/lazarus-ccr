This folder contains the gimp source file for the palette icon of the 
"colorpalette" component.

The icons with appended _150 and _200 are magnifited with respect to the
icons without appended number by factors 150% and 200%, respectively; they are 
used for screens at higher resolutions.

The icon is a slightly modified version of the icon provided with the package
originally (source unclear).
