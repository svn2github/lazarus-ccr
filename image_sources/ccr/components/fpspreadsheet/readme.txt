This folder contains the gimp source file for the palette icons of the 
visual spreadsheet components. The icons are contained within individual
layers.

The icons with appended _150 and _200 are magnifited with respect to the
icons without appended number by factors 150% and 200%, respectively; they are 
used for screens at higher resolutions.

The basic icons are taken from the Lazarus images folder. The "spreadsheet"
overlay in the lower-right corner is the file "table.png" of the FatCow icon set
(http://www.fatcow.com/free-icons, license Creative Commons Attribution 3.0).

In gimp, make sure that the "spreadsheet" overlay layer is selected. Then,
additionally select each layer, one by one, and export the resulting image to
a png file to be stored in the folder images/components of the fpspreadsheet
installation.
